								<h2>Internship - Design Engineering </h2>
								<p>I participated in a 5-week internship at A&P Falmouth where i worked with the Design Engineering team to supply the prodctuion team with new Engineering Jobs supplied by our contractors.</p>

									<h3 class="major">FEA on Stanchion</h3>
									I was tasked with analying the stanchion on the wheather deck which had been previoulsy designed by my team member. This includes finding the the Shear Stress of the M10 bolt being used aswell as a Finite - Element - Analysis (FEA) of the stanchion using inventor. After finding the rating of the bolt i went onto do calculations for the FEA. My report included assumptions for the worst case scenario which was included weight of worker anf maximum force and torque applied to stanchion and the bolt. I found the weight by assuming the worst case scenario was a 95th percentile man and with this assumtion i could also find the height of the persons shoulders which i then used for the torque and shear stress calculations. I also assumed a + 20 kg of wieght for any equipment he could have on him. Using my calculations i will then perfom the required FEA when i have access to INVENTOR again. 
									
									<h3 class="major">Flood Alarm Assembly</h3>
									<p>My First task was to accuratley model a LS-240-3E Bilge Water Level Switch in a variety of environments using AUTODESK Inventor. The Switch was modelled in 3 different environments which inluded differernt variations of barriers to ensure the they are protected form damage in the Auxillary Machine Room. I then made 2D Drawings for each model which were sent to both the MOD representative and in-house production team. </p>

									<h3 class="major">Kill Cards</h3>
									<p>I was also tasked with Drawing scaled compartmens for each Deck and assigning them with fire safety symbols, each of which with refernce to MOD fire safety standards. I then had to go onboard to ensure each compartment was fitted properly with the assigned fire saftey eqiupmemt. This ensured both the saftey of the onbeard crew was secure and that RFA Lyme Bay was upto standards set by Lloyds Surveyors and the Ministry of Defense.

									<h3 class="major">Low Level Lighting</h3>
									<p>Low Level Lighting is the safety lighting on board all Navy Ships, They ensure anyone onbard can find the quickest route to the safety no matter where they are. By saftey standards they must be able to work for a minimun of 60 minutes after power has shut down. They must also be placed in easy to see areas such as low down in case there is smoke (as people will be walking on their hands and knees). Finally, they must have a certain level of luminosity deping on the size of the compartment.
									After a survey of the the three Bay class ships had been done it was found that some of the compartments were not upto standards and so a query was raised. After a more through survey was done by A&P staff and Lloyds Surveyors a report was compiled for what parts of the ship was needing an upgrade for the Low Level Lighting System. I was then tasked with rerouting the Low Level Lighting according to safety standards for each of the RFA Lyme, Cardigan and Mounts Bay. I used AUTOCAD to place in scaled drawing of the compartments. I then used different Layers and unique Linetypes i had made myself to form the system. This was done so that it was printable on an A3 paper with a Key and the A&P NCS Information Block.
